			<h2>What is this website about?</h2>
			<p>This website is to introduce three different <br>
			kinds of phone brands, such as Apple, <br>
			Samsung, and Google. It provides a brief history of <br>
			each brand. Also, it gives a comparison of the <br>
			prices and specs of each phone.</p>

	<h3>What are the best 5G phones?</h3>
		<div class="column1"><!-- A container for a new section -->
			<p>Now that we've tested all of Apple's new 5G phones, we think the iPhone 12 Pro Max 
			is the best 5G phone. Not only does it offer an immersive screen, it turned in the 
			best battery life of any iPhone 12 model in our testing.</p><!-- This information is taken from https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-5g-phones -->

			<p>We also like the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 12, which offers many of the Pro Max's 
			great features including extensive 5G support while also costing less. We're also impressed 
			that Apple managed to include 5G support with the compact iPhone 12 mini.</p><!-- This information is taken from https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-5g-phones -->

			<p>If you prefer Android to IOS devices, we like the Galaxy S20 Plus. It works with every kind 
			of 5G network, while sporting a big OLED panel, vastly improved cameras and above-average 
			battery life. It just edges the more expensive Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, though gamers should 
			consider that phablet for its compatibility with Microsoft's streaming game service.</p><!-- This information is taken from https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-5g-phones -->
